If you have unwanted sounds in your audio recording, such as microphone pops, clicks, light hiss, and crackles, you can use the **Click/Pop Eliminator** effect to remove them. This effect is found under the **Effects > Noise Reduction/Restoration** menu. When you apply this effect, a dialog box will open where you can adjust the settings and preview the results. The dialog box will remain open until you close it, so you can select different parts of your audio and fix multiple clicks without having to reopen the effect each time.

The **Click/Pop Eliminator** effect works by detecting sudden changes in the amplitude of the audio signal, which are likely to be caused by clicks or pops. It then replaces the affected samples with interpolated values that smooth out the waveform. You can adjust the sensitivity and complexity of the detection algorithm, as well as the duration and shape of the interpolation.
  
To use the effect, first select the part of the audio that you want to fix. You can select a small region around a single click, or a larger region that contains multiple clicks. Then, choose the **Click/Pop Eliminator** effect from the **Effects > Noise Reduction/Restoration** menu. A dialog box will open where you can adjust the settings and preview the results. You can use the play button to listen to the selected audio before and after applying the effect. You can also use the zoom and scroll controls to view the waveform in more detail.
  
If you are satisfied with the results, click **Apply** to apply the effect to the selected audio. The dialog box will stay open, and you can select another part of the audio and repeat the process. You can also use the **Undo** and **Redo** buttons to undo or redo your changes. When you are done, click **Close** to close the dialog box.
