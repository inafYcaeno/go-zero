## How to Hack Other Players' Vessels?

1. Equip the hack tool in your toolbar.
2. Find a vessel that belongs to another player in a PVP zone. Make sure you avoid their turrets or find a blind spot.
3. Shoot the laser beam at their cockpit for some time until you see a message that says "Vessel Hacked".
4. Congratulations! You have successfully hacked their vessel and made it yours. You can now enter it and pilot it as you wish.

- The hack tool only works on SV, HV, and CV vessels. It does not work on BA structures.
- The hack tool also works on NPC vessels, even in PVE zones. However, be careful as some NPC vessels may have traps or self-destruct mechanisms.
- The hack tool may not work on some versions of the game or on some servers that have anti-cheat measures. Use it at your own risk.
- Hacking other players' vessels may be considered as griefing or cheating by some players or server admins. Be respectful and do not abuse this feature.
